The idea for this came from my desire to create a simple yet elegant way to browse the Quran online, page by page, with rich details about each Surah. While there are many Quran apps available, I wanted a lightweight web application that focuses on readability, authenticity, and smooth navigation without overwhelming features.

I was inspired by traditional Mushaf layouts and the beauty of the Uthmani script, combined with the modern convenience of dynamic web APIs. The goal was to bridge tradition with technology, making the Quran accessible to everyone on any device while preserving the spiritual and visual aesthetics of the text.

Additionally, working with the AlQuran Cloud API gave me a great opportunity to practice API integration and frontend architecture using vanilla JavaScript, helping me grow as a developer while creating something meaningful.

This series will take you through the journey of building this project, the challenges faced, and the solutions applied.
