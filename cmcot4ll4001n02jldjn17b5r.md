The idea for the Travel Scroll project came from a simple realization — most travel websites are either overly complicated or rely on heavy frameworks. I wanted to build a clean, scroll-based travel website that:

* Focuses on the user experience
    
* Showcases India’s diverse travel destinations
    
* Looks visually appealing while using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    

I was also inspired by the idea of storytelling through design. Each section (About, Services, Tours) contributes to the journey of a visitor on the website, just like how a traveler explores a new place. The scroll experience and filterable cards were key in making the browsing feel interactive and dynamic, without overwhelming the user.

Ultimately, this project wasn’t just about writing code — it was about creating an immersive experience that reflects the beauty, culture, and diversity of Indian tourism, while reinforcing core front-end development skills.
